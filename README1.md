    <br>
        <p>Learning to drive is the most interseting and enjoyable task for me. I wish one day i can drive a convertible and enjoy the breathtaking scene in Hong Kong even though buying a car in Hong Kong is tough.</p>
        <p>Working in Mcdonald must be the least enjoyable task for me. Sometimes, customers can blame you for no reason. Also, overtime working is quite common in Mcdonald. Before the pandemic, I often work from 4pm to 3am.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the experience in Mcdonald, I am able to work in stress for a long time and follow the deadline strictly.</p>
        <p>But I just need to work harder on programming, there is too much to learn in programming. Understanding the coode takes a lot of time and often make me feel dizzy.</p>
